# Speed Dating Data Site

**Intro**

Here we have collected and analyzed data from a speed dating event that was conducted at Columbia University, NY, between October 2002 and April 2004. In this event there were a total of 551 participants over the course of 21 waves. Each participant had an opportunity to meet with each other person of the opposite gender who participated in the same wave they did. After a four minute date, both participants filled out a scorecard about the person they went on the date with. We have taken this data and have highlighted the sections of it that we believe would be useful for organizers and participants of future speed date events to know. Over the four pages on this website, we have laid out the information in a fun and eye catching way.

**Design**

The design of the website is adaptable, meaning you can view it from any kind of device, whether phone, tablet, or desktop. [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) is the library we used for the total of 15 charts you can see throughout the website. [Unsplash](https://www.unplash.com/) was used to find royalty free pictures, seen in the headers of all the pages. [FlatIcon](https://www.flaticon.com/) is what was used to find all the logos that you see in the nav bar and the footer. This is a React app, which made the multipage function a little bit harder than expected to incorporate, however this issue was fixed by using [ReactRouter](https://reactrouter.com/en/main). The majority of the website is coded with JS, with CSS being the primary styling.
